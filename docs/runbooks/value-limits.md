# Value-Limit Policy Runbook

Audience: operators of controlled-devnet Morph Channel deployments preparing
for any future real-assets phase. The value-limit policy is the operator
control the roadmap requires before any real-assets claim; it is host-side
only and never weakens the on-chain script boundary.

## 1. What the policy controls

A `ValueLimitPolicy` declares:

- `max_channel_ckb_capacity`: the largest CKB capacity (base units) a channel
  vault may commit;
- `max_xudt_amounts`: one cap per admitted xUDT type (canonical `0x`-prefixed
  32-byte hex). **Any asset not listed is rejected outright** (fail closed).

Enforcement is additive: it can only reject, never authorise. The CKB scripts
remain the final boundary for every on-chain rule.

## 2. Authoring and reviewing a policy

1. Start from the fixture:
   `cargo run -p morph-cli -- print-value-limit-policy-fixture > policy.json`
2. Edit the caps to values justified by evidence (liquidity, insurance, or
   experiment budgets). Every cap must have a written rationale; a cap
   without a rationale is optimism, not policy.
3. Validate and record the digest:
   `cargo run -p morph-cli -- validate-value-limit-policy policy.json --json`
   The `digest` field is a deterministic commitment over the declared caps;
   record it in the deployment log and in every broadcast approval.
4. Store the policy file with the channel's other operator records; policy
   rotation follows the same review path (new file, new digest, new sign-off).

## 3. Applying the policy

Check a value-bearing package before signing or broadcasting it:

```sh
cargo run -p morph-cli -- value-limit-check \
  --policy policy.json \
  --package factory-splice-in.json
```

Supported package schemas are the value-bearing splice surfaces:
`morph.splice_package`, `morph.factory_splice_package`, and
`morph.factory_reduced_splice_package`. The subject is the peak committed
channel holding computed component-wise across the old and new vault
descriptors. Packages are fully decoded and validated before extraction;
unknown, incomplete, or digest-invalid packages fail closed. Withdrawals and
remaining settlement are partitions of those committed vault amounts, not
additional holdings, so they are not double-counted.

Ad-hoc checks (for example when sizing a new channel) use explicit amounts:

```sh
cargo run -p morph-cli -- value-limit-check \
  --policy policy.json \
  --ckb 200000000000 \
  --xudt 0x<32-byte-type-hash>:5000
```

## 4. Failure handling

- `channel CKB capacity ... exceeds the policy cap` or
  `xUDT asset ... exceeds the policy cap`: do not broadcast. Reduce the
  package amounts or raise the cap through review.
- `xUDT asset ... is not admitted`: the asset is entirely outside the
  deployment's declared scope. Do not add it casually; adding an asset is a
  policy change with the same review weight as a cap raise.
- Digest mismatch in an approval: the policy file changed after review.
  Stop and re-review.

## 5. Boundaries

- The policy does not inspect witness validity, signatures, or script
  consensus; those checks remain with `validate-*-package` commands and the
  on-chain scripts. Run both.
- The policy applies to stored package files. Live RPC-submitted transactions
  are checked only if the operator routes them through package tooling first;
  keep publication flows package-based until that changes.
- CI evidence: `make fixture-checks` validates the policy fixture and applies
  it to the factory splice-in fixture on every run.
