# Fiber/Morph Devnet Runbook

This runbook is for operators who need clear evidence that Morph and Fiber can
share a local CKB devnet while covering the committed business-flow and security
model matrix.

The canonical release gate is:

```sh
make fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance-full
```

Use this runbook when preparing a release candidate, reviewing a protocol
change, or checking whether a local devnet run contains enough business-flow
evidence to trust.

## Quick Decision Table

| Need | Command | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check local dependencies only | `make fiber-morph-devnet-preflight` | Creates a run directory with `status=preflight-passed`. |
| Prove Morph/Fiber coexistence and Agent multi-hop | `make fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance` | Runs Morph stateful scenarios, Fiber external funding, and Morph Agent x402/fair-exchange over a real three-node Fiber route. |
| Prove the full Morph plus Fiber matrix | `make fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance-full` | Runs coexistence, strict Fiber Bruno suites, funding-tx verification, and the combined audit. |
| Recheck existing evidence | `make fiber-morph-devnet-audit FIBER_MORPH_ACCEPTANCE_RUN=target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>` | Rebuilds `business-flow-audit.json` from an existing run. |
| Debug only the Fiber strict matrix | `FIBER_MORPH_ACCEPTANCE_MODE=fiber scripts/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance.sh` | Runs Fiber suites without the Morph stateful matrix. |

Production acceptance expects a clean Morph worktree. Commit or stash local code
changes before the `coexistence`, `fiber`, or `full` gates.

## Before You Run

Expected checkout layout:

```text
parent/
  Morph/ or morph-channel/
  fiber/
  ckb/
  ckb-cli/
```

The acceptance script can clone missing upstream repositories, but release
evidence is easier to audit when all four checkouts already exist and are on the
intended branches.

Required tools:

- Rust and Cargo
- `jq`
- `curl`
- Node.js and `npm`
- either `lsof` or `ss` (from iproute2) for deterministic failed-stack cleanup
- CKB and ckb-cli build prerequisites

Fiber's devnet helpers use `nc -z` for loopback readiness probes. When netcat
is not installed, the Morph runner automatically exposes its restricted
loopback-only `scripts/nc-z-shim.sh` in the per-run tool directory.

The runner also supplies `FIBER_CXXFLAGS=-include cstdint` by default. This is
a build-only compatibility flag for Fiber's locked `ckb-librocksdb-sys 8.5.4`
on modern C++ compilers; it is recorded in the acceptance manifest and does
not patch the Fiber checkout.

For the same-chain Morph transaction matrix, the runner explicitly reads
Fiber's public devnet fixture keys for the funded deployer and the two Morph
channel signers. This removes dependence on secret variables inherited from
an operator shell. Only fixture file paths are recorded; key material is never
printed. Override `MORPH_FIBER_{DEPLOYER,ALICE,BOB}_KEY_FILE` when using a
different disposable devnet.

Run:

```sh
make fiber-morph-devnet-preflight
```

If this fails, fix the dependency or checkout problem before running the full
gate. Preflight does not start devnet nodes.

## Canonical Full Run

Run from the Morph repository:

```sh
make fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance-full
```

The full gate performs these phases:

1. Records Morph, Fiber, CKB, and ckb-cli repository state.
2. Starts Fiber's three-node local devnet stack.
3. Builds Morph RISC-V CKB scripts.
4. Runs Morph's strict stateful scenario matrix against Fiber's CKB RPC.
5. Runs Fiber external funding on the same CKB devnet.
6. Runs the Fiber external-funding restart regression.
7. Starts a fresh Fiber `router-pay` topology and runs its Bruno suite.
8. Runs Morph Agent x402/credential and fair-exchange payments from Fiber
   node1 through node2 to node3.
9. Starts fresh Fiber devnets for the remaining strict Fiber Bruno suite set.
10. Runs the four Fiber funding-transaction verification cases.
11. Writes the acceptance matrix, summary, and business-flow audit.

A successful run ends with:

```text
full Fiber/Morph acceptance passed
```

The run directory is:

```text
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/
```

## Business Flows Covered

The full gate covers both user-visible channel operations and adversarial
conditions. The audit is intentionally strict: a JSON pass is not enough unless
the expected files and log markers are present.

### Cross-Repository Flow

| Flow | What it proves | Main evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Same CKB devnet coexistence | Morph deploys and exercises scripts on the CKB node started by Fiber, then Fiber runs channel acceptance on that same node. | `acceptance-matrix.json`, `morph-stateful/scenarios/summary-check.json`, `fiber-bruno-e2e_external-funding-open.json` |

### Morph Business Flows

| Flow | User story | Security point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bilateral direct publish and finalise | Two participants publish the latest signed channel state and settle the vault. | State authority and final settlement are bound to the current StateCell. |
| Bilateral supersede, watchtower, and finalise | A stale publication is superseded and a watchtower publishes the newer state before finalisation. | Stale state cannot win when fresher evidence exists. |
| Sponsor fee pressure | Sponsor funding, fee ceilings, and invalid sponsor ranges are exercised. | Sponsor policy boundaries reject fee leakage and state-range abuse. |
| Splice lifecycle matrix | CKB and xUDT splice-in and splice-out update funding anchors and vault sets. | Funding-anchor and descriptor changes require signed evidence. |
| Factory lifecycle matrix | Factory open, update, reduced rights, sparse Merkle update, local child exit, and reduced exit all execute. | Factory rights and child value cannot be changed without the required proof. |
| Factory splice then exit | Conservative and reduced CKB/xUDT factory splice paths can be followed by child materialisation and finalisation. | Factory value deltas are bound across reserve, balance, and vault cells. |
| Watchtower operations | Auto-sponsor, direct sponsor, config-loop, health-file, cursor, service stop, and stale-splice watching are recorded. | Watchtower publication is cursor-aware and funding-context-aware, with funding-anchor fallback for older packages. |
| Extreme state value cases | Asymmetric capacities and one-sided xUDT paths remain valid. | Edge-value cases do not bypass typed-asset or budget checks. |
| Negative attack matrix | Known attack-shaped transactions fail with exact expected errors, then later valid transitions still commit. | Rejection paths are precise and recovery continues afterwards. |

The Morph stateful assertion also enforces minimum evidence floors, including
committed transactions, factory splices, factory local exits, watchtower alerts,
referenced artefacts, and exact expected failures.

### Morph Agent Business Flows

| Flow | User story | Security point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x402 over Fiber multi-hop | A signed payer challenge is paid from node1 through node2 to node3, then yields a terminal Morph receipt and reusable Biscuit credential. | `Created`/`Inflight` are never treated as settlement; payer/payee identity and the paid resource remain bound. |
| Fair exchange over Fiber multi-hop | An encrypted Agent result is paid across the same route and decrypted with the released hash preimage. | The key and plaintext remain unavailable until terminal paid evidence, and the result hash/AAD bind the exchange. |

### Fiber Business Flows

| Flow | User story | Security point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| External funding open | A channel is opened through Fiber's external funding path. | Externally built funding transactions are accepted only when they match the channel intent. |
| External funding restart | The external funding flow survives node restart before signed funding submission. | Funding state is durable across process restart. |
| Open, use, close a channel | Peers open a channel, exchange payments, and cooperatively close it. | Cooperative settlement produces the expected terminal state. |
| Three-node transfer | A routed payment moves through an intermediate node. | Multi-hop transfer and channel shutdown evidence are present. |
| Router pay | Routing, duplicate payment controls, self-pay rejection, and graph updates are exercised. | The routing graph and payment identifiers cannot be abused for duplicate settlement. |
| Re-establish | Peers disconnect and reconnect, then re-establish channel state. | Recovery preserves agreed state after network interruption. |
| Shutdown force | A force-close path is triggered after peer disconnect. | Uncooperative close remains available. |
| Hold invoice cancel failure | A cancelled hold invoice returns the expected decoded failure. | TLC failure semantics are observable and precise. |
| Periodic expiry cleanup | Periodic checks remove expired TLCs. | Expired conditional payments cannot remain unresolved; force-close itself is covered by the shutdown and watchtower suites. |
| UDT channel flow | Fiber opens and settles typed-asset channel activity. | Typed assets stay bound to the expected channel type. |
| UDT router pay | Routed UDT payment succeeds through Fiber. | Typed-asset routing preserves the asset identity. |
| Watchtower force-close after open | Watchtower handles force close after channel open. | Watchtower settlement is active even with minimal payment history. |
| Watchtower force-close with pending TLCs | Watchtower handles force close with pending conditional transfers. | Pending transfer settlement is enforced during force close. |
| Watchtower force-close after multiple payments | Watchtower handles force close after repeated payments. | Repeated state updates do not break watchtower recovery. |
| Watchtower remote force-close with stopped watchtower | Remote force-close is exercised when the watchtower has been stopped. | Recovery behaviour is checked around watchtower availability boundaries. |
| Funding tx verification: remove change | A tampered funding transaction with removed change is rejected. | Funding transaction output shape is checked. |
| Funding tx verification: modify change | A tampered funding transaction with modified change is rejected. | Change output mutation is detected. |
| Funding tx verification: fund from peer | A funding transaction using peer funds is rejected. | Funding ownership assumptions are enforced. |
| Funding tx verification: missing inputs | A funding transaction with missing inputs is rejected. | Required funding inputs cannot be omitted. |

## Security Model Checklist

The combined audit writes security families into `business-flow-audit.json`.
Treat these as the high-level security checklist for a full run.

Morph families:

- `state_authority_authenticity`
- `canonical_relative_maturity`
- `state_retirement_non_orphaning`
- `signed_descriptor_evolution`
- `non_interference_not_authorisation`
- `factory_value_delta_binding`
- `typed_asset_binding`
- `sponsor_policy_boundary`
- `watchtower_authority_and_cursor`
- `negative_recovery_continuity`
- `budget_regression`

Fiber families:

- `fiber_external_funding_persistence`
- `fiber_funding_tx_shape_validation`
- `fiber_cooperative_close_settlement`
- `fiber_force_close_watchtower_settlement`
- `fiber_tlc_error_and_failure_semantics`
- `fiber_routing_graph_and_duplicate_payment_controls`
- `fiber_reconnect_reestablish_recovery`
- `fiber_typed_asset_channel_binding`
- `fiber_periodic_expiry_recovery`

Morph Agent families:

- `morph_agent_terminal_payment_identity_binding`
- `morph_agent_credential_hashlock_release`

For release evidence, every listed family must be present in
`business-flow-audit.json`, and the top-level run summary must say
`"status": "passed"`.

## Reading The Artefacts

Start with these files:

```text
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/manifest.txt
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/repo-state.json
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/acceptance-matrix.json
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/summary.json
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/business-flow-audit.json
```

Then inspect subsystem evidence:

```text
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/morph-stateful/scenarios/summary.json
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/morph-stateful/scenarios/summary-check.json
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/logs/morph-stateful-on-fiber-ckb.log
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/morph-agent-fiber-e2e/result.json
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/morph-agent-fiber-e2e/manifest.json
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/fiber-bruno-*.json
target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/logs/fiber-bruno-*.log
```

Useful checks:

```sh
jq '.status, .mode' target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/summary.json
jq '.business_flows | length' target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/business-flow-audit.json
jq '.security_families | length' target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/business-flow-audit.json
jq '.minimum_evidence' target/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance/<run-id>/business-flow-audit.json
```

For a full run, expect:

- 31 business flows
- 22 security families
- 19 required Fiber business flows
- 9 required Fiber security families
- 2 required Morph Agent business flows
- 2 required Morph Agent security families
- 4 Fiber funding-transaction verification cases

## Failure Handling

Use the failing command's run directory. Do not delete it before audit.

1. Read `manifest.txt`. If it lacks `status=passed`, the run failed before the
   final audit.
2. Read `logs/morph-stateful-on-fiber-ckb.log` for Morph scenario failures.
3. Read the relevant `fiber-bruno-*.json`, then open the log path stored in its
   `.log` field.
4. Rerun `make fiber-morph-devnet-audit FIBER_MORPH_ACCEPTANCE_RUN=<run-dir>`
   after fixing missing evidence or stale artefacts.
5. If the audit reports a missing log marker, the suite may have passed without
   proving the expected behaviour. Fix the test or the audit marker before
   accepting the run.

Common causes:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clean-worktree error | Local source files changed before a production gate. | Commit, stash, or run only preflight. |
| Missing CKB or ckb-cli binary | Sibling checkout is absent or not built. | Run preflight, then build the reported dependency. |
| Morph freshness failure | Artefacts were generated from a different Morph commit. | Rerun the gate from a clean current commit. |
| Missing Fiber result file | A strict Fiber suite or funding case was skipped. | Use the default `FIBER_BRUNO_SUITES` and `FIBER_FUNDING_TX_VERIFICATION_CASES`. |
| Missing Morph Agent result | The Agent process, terminal payment polling, or three-node `router-pay` substrate failed. | Inspect `logs/morph-agent-fiber-e2e.log`, both Agent logs, and the router-pay Bruno log. |
| Missing Fiber log marker | The Bruno suite did not produce the required behavioural evidence. | Inspect the suite log and update the test or marker deliberately. |
| `external-funding-open` balance/readiness failure | Current Fiber Bruno balance deltas can be stale even when open/sign/submit/close/inspect requests succeed. | The coexistence harness accepts only the known stale shape and still requires the critical request markers. |

## Narrow Debug Runs

Use narrow runs only for diagnosis. They are not release acceptance.

```sh
FIBER_BRUNO_SUITES="e2e/router-pay" \
FIBER_MORPH_ACCEPTANCE_MODE=fiber \
scripts/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance.sh
```

```sh
FIBER_FUNDING_TX_VERIFICATION_CASES="missing_inputs" \
FIBER_MORPH_ACCEPTANCE_MODE=fiber \
scripts/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance.sh
```

```sh
BUILD_MORPH_CONTRACTS=0 make fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance
```

When the debug run passes, rerun the canonical full gate before declaring the
candidate accepted.

## Release Evidence Statement

A release candidate has acceptable local devnet evidence only when all of the
following are true:

- `make fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance-full` exits successfully.
- `manifest.txt` contains `status=passed`.
- `summary.json` contains `"status": "passed"` and `"mode": "full"`.
- `business-flow-audit.json` contains the expected 31 business flows and 22
  security families.
- Morph `summary-check.json` passes all stateful, budget, factory, xUDT,
  watchtower, and negative-path floors.
- Every strict Fiber suite and funding-transaction verification case has both a
  passing JSON result and the required log evidence.
- Morph Agent evidence contains both terminal three-node payments, matching
  identities/network IDs, and a manifest with `secrets_recorded=false`.

This is a local devnet acceptance gate. It proves the committed same-devnet
business-flow and security matrix, not mainnet readiness or cross-repository
protocol merger by itself.
