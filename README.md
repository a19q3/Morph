# Morph Channel

Morph Channel is a CKB-native channel prototype. It shows how two people, or a
small factory of people, can move channel state off chain while CKB keeps the
enforceable evidence on chain.

Current source release: **v2.0.0 — Factory 2.0 Surface and Value-Limit Policy**.

The short version is:

- channel value stays in vault cells;
- the latest enforceable state is carried by a state cell;
- publication fees are paid by sponsor cells, not by channel balances;
- newer signed state can replace older settling state before finalisation;
- factories can hold shared reserve rights and materialise child channels.

This is devnet software and a research implementation, not mainnet
infrastructure. The useful claim today is narrower: the repository contains
executable protocol checks, CKB script tests, local devnet flows, and stateful
acceptance reports for the channel and factory paths it implements.

## Why This Exists

In many channel systems, the object that holds value and the object that proves
the latest state are tightly coupled. CKB lets Morph separate those jobs.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U["Alice and Bob"] <-->|"signed updates"| O["Off-chain state"]
    O --> S["State Cell<br/>latest enforceable evidence"]
    S --> V["Vault Cell<br/>channel value"]
    P["Sponsor Cell<br/>publication fees"] --> S
    V --> W["Withdrawal outputs"]
```

This separation is the core idea from the paper:

- the vault protects user value;
- the state cell says which state can settle that value;
- sponsor funds pay bounded fees for state publication and supersede;
- factory state tracks shared reserve rights without exposing every unrelated
  participant detail on every local action.

The design tries to make disputes boring. A script should be able to answer
simple questions: who signed this state, is it newer, does it match the current
funding context, do the vault outputs match the descriptor, and did any channel
value leak into fees or sponsor change?

## What Works Today

Implemented locally:

- bilateral CKB channels: open, publish, supersede, finalise, and sponsored
  publication;
- CKB and xUDT settlement through the same state/vault authority model;
- splice-in and splice-out, so a channel can be resized without starting over;
- watchtower-style package publication with cursor persistence, policy checks,
  canonical block-hash reorg recovery, JSONL alerts, and optional webhook alerts;
- conservative factory updates signed by all factory participants;
- factory local exits that materialise child bilateral channels;
- reduced factory paths for bounded rights updates, exits, sparse-Merkle
  updates, and splices, carried by `WitnessEnvelope`;
- multi-right factory updates (envelope kind 8): one touched participant
  atomically updates up to four of their own value rights per update, each
  localised by a compact variable-depth sparse-Merkle proof that omits empty
  siblings; see `docs/v2.0-plan.md`;
- a fail-closed operator value-limit policy with a runbook
  (`docs/runbooks/value-limits.md`), checked by `morph-cli value-limit-check`;
- two-stage bilateral/Factory Vault activation that binds enforceable state to
  an exact CKB OutPoint and rejects byte-identical clone substitution;
- type-bound FactoryState locking and exact State/Factory carrier-capacity
  conservation, so fee-payer signatures do not become Factory authority;
- devnet smoke and stateful acceptance reports that bind scenarios to real
  transactions, cycle estimates, and expected negative-path failures;
- experimental Morph-owned RGB++/x402 Agent, native bilateral
  `ChannelBackend`, Factory-right edge registry, and isolated Fiber-hook
  adapter. The Agent x402/credential/fair-exchange flow is exercised over a
  real three-node Fiber devnet route; a real Fiber external-edge hook routing
  a Morph-backed channel is not yet implemented.

Still not claimed:

- mainnet readiness;
- independent external review;
- long-running multi-operator watchtower evidence;
- production fee and reorganisation measurements;
- independent release artefact and supply-chain sign-off;
- any real-asset value envelope.

The bounded `factory-dynamic-n` controlled-devnet candidate has a
machine-checked no-real-assets envelope, exact CKB contract data-hash manifest,
operator runbooks, and CI provenance configuration. Verify it with:

```sh
make build-contracts
make release-readiness
make package-contract-release
```

This closes repository-side pre-production mechanics only; it does not change
the mainnet disclaimer. Factory signer membership is bounded to 2–16, while
reduced proofs retain their fixed count and depth limits.

```

### Open A Channel

Opening creates a State Cell and a Vault Cell. From the user's point of view,
this is the deposit step: funds move from a normal wallet cell into cells
controlled by channel rules.

### Update Off Chain

Participants exchange signed states. Most updates do not touch CKB. A higher
state number beats a lower one when a dispute reaches the chain.

### Publish If Needed

If cooperation fails, a participant or watchtower can publish a saved package.
The transaction may use sponsor capacity for fees, but sponsor funds do not
become channel value and channel value does not become sponsor change.

### Finalise And Withdraw

After the relative `since` delay, the vault can be spent only against the
current settling State Cell and its settlement descriptor. This is the withdrawal
step.

### Resize / Re-anchor (Wire Name: Splice)

The user-facing operation is a channel resize or funding re-anchor. The current
wire format and CLI retain the historical `SPLICE` name. Resize-in adds value
and resize-out removes value while keeping `channel_id` as the stable logical
identity. Tooling selects the live funding object by its derived
`funding_context_id`; old watch packages must not be reused unless that signed
context still matches the live state track. A resize-out also signs the exact
participant withdrawal lock, and the vault script requires the corresponding
CKB/xUDT output on chain.

### Use A Factory

A factory groups reserve rights under a Factory State Cell and Factory Vault
Cell. Conservative updates require all participants. Reduced paths are allowed
only when the proof shows that a bounded local right changed and unrelated
rights stayed committed.

Important scripts:

- `morph-state-type`: state-cell progression and signed-state checks;
- `morph-state-lock`: state-cell lock boundary;
- `morph-vault-lock`: vault settlement and splice checks;
- `morph-sponsor-lock`: bounded sponsor fee spending;
- `morph-factory-type`: factory state progression, signatures, reduced proofs,
  exits, and envelope dispatch;
- `morph-factory-vault-lock`: factory reserve conservation;
- `morph-devnet-xudt`: local xUDT issuer/conservation script for devnet tests.

## Quick Start

Run the local checks:

```sh
make ci
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
make fixture-checks
make build-contracts
make contract-tests
```

Check the devnet environment:

```sh
scripts/check-devnet-env.sh
```

Run the local operator console:

```sh
cd ui/morph-hub
npm install
npm run build
cd ../..
cargo run -p morph-cli -- hub serve \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:4617 \
  --pubkey "${MORPH_PUBKEY:?set MORPH_PUBKEY to the local compressed secp256k1 pubkey}" \
  --state-path target/morph-hub/node-state.json \
  --ckb-rpc-url "${MORPH_CKB_RPC:-http://127.0.0.1:18114}" \
  --rotate-auth-token-on-restart
```

Set `MORPH_PUBKEY` to the local 33-byte compressed secp256k1 public key as
66 hex characters without `0x`, matching Fiber's RPC-facing node identity
format. Morph derives its internal 32-byte node id from that pubkey. Then open
`http://127.0.0.1:4617/`. During UI development, `npm run dev` proxies `/api`
to that hub server.

When you have a real watchtower JSONL output from a devnet run, add
`--watch-alert-file "$MORPH_WATCH_ALERT_FILE"`. Without that file, Morph Hub
keeps channel, invoice, peer, and factory rows clearly marked as local Hub state
rather than chain evidence.

Morph Hub is token-first. Start with `--auth-token`, `--auth-token-file`,
`--auth-token-stdin`, `--rotate-auth-token-on-restart`, or
`MORPH_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN`; prefer the file, stdin, or rotate-on-restart modes so
the shared secret is not left in shell history, process listings, or environment
dumps. Rotation is restart-based: start the hub with
`--rotate-auth-token-on-restart`, copy the printed `morph_hub_auth_token=...`
value into the browser unlock prompt, and stop using the old token. Scoped
tokens are supported with
`read,write,restore,sign:<secret>`; omit the prefix only for an all-scope token.
For local development only, `--allow-unauthenticated-loopback` explicitly
restores no-token loopback mode. Direct cross-origin browser access is disabled
unless `--cors-origin` is set to an explicit `http://` or `https://` origin.
Replacing the durable state file through the UI/API is disabled by default; add
`--allow-state-restore` only when you intentionally need that operator recovery
path. Rows shown in the console are labelled as local Hub state unless future
chain evidence fields prove otherwise.

The console keeps itself current while it is open. Explicit
`--allow-unauthenticated-loopback` sessions use `/api/events` server-sent
events; token-protected sessions use authenticated short polling so the bearer
token is never placed in an event-stream URL. When the API requires a token, the
UI accepts it at runtime and stores it only in the browser session.

The experimental `morph-agent` also defaults to a local-only trust boundary.
Plain HTTP is accepted only for loopback Agent, Fiber RPC, callback, and fixed
Gateway endpoints; remote endpoints must use HTTPS. A non-loopback Agent
listener additionally requires `--api-bearer-token` or
`MORPH_AGENT_API_BEARER_TOKEN` with at least 32 bytes. That token protects
durable challenge/offer creation and the redacted payment index, and is
supported by both native SDKs. Keep Fiber and Agent bearer tokens out of URLs,
logs, and shell history.

With a local CKB devnet node running through `scripts/devnet-node.sh`:

```sh
cargo run -p morph-cli --features devnet -- devnet --devnet-only check
cargo run -p morph-cli --features devnet -- devnet --devnet-only mine --blocks 1
cargo run -p morph-cli --features devnet -- devnet --devnet-only deploy-contracts
cargo run -p morph-cli --features devnet -- devnet --devnet-only open-channel
cargo run -p morph-cli --features devnet -- devnet --devnet-only supersede-smoke
cargo run -p morph-cli --features devnet -- devnet --devnet-only xudt-smoke
cargo run -p morph-cli --features devnet -- devnet --devnet-only factory-reduced-rights-smoke
cargo run -p morph-cli --features devnet -- devnet --devnet-only factory-merkle-update-smoke
cargo run -p morph-cli --features devnet -- devnet --devnet-only factory-reduced-exit-smoke
make devnet-smoke
make devnet-e2e
make devnet-stateful-e2e
make fiber-morph-devnet-preflight
make fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance
```

Reports are written under `target/devnet-smoke/` and
`target/devnet-stateful-e2e/`. The `latest` symlink points to the newest
successful run when it is safe to refresh.

The Fiber/Morph acceptance path starts Fiber's local CKB devnet stack, runs
Morph's stateful channel/factory matrix against that CKB RPC, and then runs
Fiber channel acceptance on the same devnet. See
[fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance.md](docs/fiber-morph-devnet-acceptance.md) and
[fiber-morph-devnet-runbook.md](docs/fiber-morph-devnet-runbook.md).

## Common CLI Workflows

Generate and validate factory packages:

```sh
cargo run -p morph-cli -- print-factory-fixture > target/factory-update.json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- validate-factory-package target/factory-update.json --json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- print-factory-reduced-rights-fixture \
  > target/factory-reduced-rights.json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- validate-factory-reduced-rights-package \
  target/factory-reduced-rights.json --json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- print-factory-reduced-exit-fixture \
  > target/factory-reduced-exit.json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- validate-factory-reduced-exit-package \
  target/factory-reduced-exit.json --json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- print-factory-merkle-update-fixture \
  > target/factory-merkle-update.json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- validate-factory-merkle-update-package \
  target/factory-merkle-update.json --json
```

Generate and validate splice packages:

```sh
cargo run -p morph-cli -- print-splice-fixture --kind splice-in \
  > target/splice-in.json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- validate-splice-package target/splice-in.json --json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- print-splice-fixture --kind xudt-splice-out \
  > target/xudt-splice-out.json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- validate-splice-package \
  target/xudt-splice-out.json --json
```

Run watchtower-style publication:

```sh
cargo run -p morph-cli -- print-watch-policy-fixture > target/watch-policy.json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- validate-watch-policy target/watch-policy.json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- print-watch-config-fixture > target/watch-config.json
cargo run -p morph-cli -- validate-watch-config target/watch-config.json
cargo run -p morph-cli --features devnet -- devnet --devnet-only watch-config-once \
  --config target/watch-config.json \
  --private-key-file target/watchtower-owner.key \
  --json
```

Run the production-publication reliability rehearsal against a fresh local CKB
devnet (no CI/CD integration is implied):

```sh
CKB_BIN=../ckb/target/debug/ckb \
  scripts/devnet-publication-reliability.sh
```

This exercises fee-floor rejection, two least-privilege process/key scopes on
one host and one loopback RPC,
cross-operator CKB RBF contention, durable attempt reconciliation, mempool
eviction without a reorg, duplicate rebroadcast, injected delay, and an
IntegrationTest `truncate` reorg. The local report intentionally does not
satisfy the production requirement for 1000 fresh public-network samples.

Compare smoke reports:

```sh
cargo run -p morph-cli -- devnet-smoke-report --dir target/devnet-smoke/latest
cargo run -p morph-cli -- devnet-smoke-compare \
  --baseline target/devnet-smoke/<old-run> \
  --candidate target/devnet-smoke/<new-run> \
  --fail-on-transaction-set-change \
  --fail-on-status-change \
  --max-abs-total-byte-delta 0 \
  --max-abs-tx-byte-delta 0
```

## Maturity

Morph Channel should be read as a serious devnet research implementation. It is
not production infrastructure yet.

The bar for that claim is concrete: independent review, repeated devnet and
testnet runs under realistic fees and reorg conditions, CI-backed release
artefacts, operator runbooks, multi-operator watchtower evidence, and explicit
value limits.
